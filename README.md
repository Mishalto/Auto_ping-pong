# Auto Ping Pong
A two-player ping pong game.  
Controls: **W, A, S, D** for Player 1 (move up, down, left, right), **Arrow keys** for Player 2 (move left and right).

## Design
All the core logic is handled by the **GameEngine**.  
One of the unique features of the game is inertia - the acceleration depends on the player's movement.

## Build
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a stable version of CMake, and Git.  
3. CMake will automatically pull SFML, and after that, the project will be ready to use.
